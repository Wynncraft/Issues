                 I keep falling in the void and i can't do anythink @Wynncraft/game

1.I went into the nether from the hub (by clicking the sign)
2.I stood there for 2-3 minutes
3.And,when I wrote /leave I started falling in the void (I was takeing damage but it regened fast)
4.I tried to switch from a server to another but it didn't work :(
5.Now my "Y" is at -100.000 and it's still going down

 I hope you will solve that very soon.
