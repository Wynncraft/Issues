I am having a bug where my game wont let me attack or be hit because the game ended when i was finishing a quest. What do i do?
I was doing the bowl quest for yaha (spelled wrong) and when i gave him the bowl and the the server ended. It thinks that im 
still talking to him so i cant do anything. Please help. I put a long time into this and i dont want to lose it.
