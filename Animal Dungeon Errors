Hey. Name's Blade, I'm a long-time Wynn player. Was helping my frined through hte Animal Dungeo nand found a BIG error. The center button to press on the parkour to open the gate down to the tree parkour? A large (I mean multiple Chunk) area of that section and the one below is completely gone. And no, it's not an error on my computer. This is my third computer getting on, I've relogged tried accessing it from another World, etc. It's just gone. Any help would be appreciated. If you get to this soon, I'll be on World 14.
