I was lagging alot on 16/06/15 (Australian Date) and I died due to the lag but when I respawned in Nemract I was stuck in the ground, I was a mage kit so I decided to try and teleport out of there but it didnt work, I also tried a teleportation scroll to Detlas but that didnt work either, I need a way out!
