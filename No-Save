This morning, I was playing on WynnCraft as usual. Then I had found this guy and befriended him. We played for a hour and I had gotten really lucky with the stuff I had been getting. I had sold alot of my stuff, made space in my bank, made lots of emeralds from farming and the stuff I sold, and even found this wand called Celisital or something like that. I had been collecting a lot of stff, and even completed a mission. By the time the server was restarting, I was already at least level 22 with my new helmet and my new identified stuff.At the end of the time, I had begun dueling people in order to complete my misson. After the thrid duel, I competed my mission. Then my new friend wanted to trade. I had accepted at the last second, not remembering that it was restart nor looking at the chat too often. As soon as it quit, I had gone back to the same sever, ALL MY STUFF WAS GONE AS IF I NEVER PLAYED TODAY! This had only happened to me as my friend still had the witherstrings bow I found and gave him. Please help me and I want my stuff back. I even had some leech leggings for my brother so he can compete his gold set.
