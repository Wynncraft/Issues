I lost all my items that i was holding (not including quest items), I didn't died , but all my holding items were replaced by an Oak wood stick , this is the second time that happens to me, i would like this bug fixed. I was with 2 soul points , but i didn't died , i was standing in nesaak , in a building AFK , then when i came back i wasn't with my items anymore , just an old Oak wood stick
