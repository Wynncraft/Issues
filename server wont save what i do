hi i have been playing your server a few days now and its rely fun but the other day i loged on and i went into a dungon. im not very good at dungons so it took me a long time to get out. when i left i folowd a trail and did 2 qwests and went up two levels when i loged out and loged back on later that day i was back in the dungon i was back at level 11 again and all the stuff i had colected after i left the dungon was gon. now i was as you can imagin anoyed but decided to give the server the benifit of the doubt and kept playing.i got myself back up to the stats i was at b4 and i loged off. when i came back on it had happedn again. this is extreamly anoying and i and not doing thos qwests for a third time also i am stuck in the dungon again and it takes for ever to get out
