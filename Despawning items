I only had 2 soul points left so I decided to spend the night in Nemract until sunrise so I could get a 3rd soul point. While wating in Nemract I was killed by zombies. So I respawned and went back to where I died in about 5 seconds. When I go there, everything was gone. First of all why are Zombies in the town, and second of all, why did my items despawn so quick? I am only this mad because I had a fully identified Butter Helm and fully identified Retina Shooter with a red powder on it. Thanks for help.
