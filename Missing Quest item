My IGN is Dawoof1248. So a while ago I finished the quest called underwater (the one where you get the breathing helmet) and now I'm trying to do the quest call underice, but the problem is the helmet is not in my inventory or my enderchest. I was wondering if you could spawn me in another breathing helmet.
