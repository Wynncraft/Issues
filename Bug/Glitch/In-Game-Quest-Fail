Hello. SDobzSticklezD Here.

I am pretty new to WynnCraft and so far i love it! Its an awesome server.
But i was casually doing the quests when i started the Prison quest and basically 
i did it but then the world had to restart and i went back on and it said i hadnt done it,
I tried 3 more times after that but then the guy would not give me the key and i didnt already have it,
So now i cant complete the quest because i dont have the key and i can not get it again ? 
Please help! - Thankyou for reading!
